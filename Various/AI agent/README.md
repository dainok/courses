Claude 3.7? Can you even test it without changing all your applications?
You need a LLM Gateway

You wouldn't implement and call your APIs individually, would you? Why are you doing it for your LLMs?

LLM Gateways allow you to:
- Interface with multiple LLMs using the same syntax
- Receive the output in the same format
- Track LLM Usage and setup guardrails
- Logging, Guardrails, Caching

They are simple to implement, LiteLLM is one but there are others.

How are you doing it today? Direct to provider or you have an abstraction?
